This is my new github account that i am planning on using for my projects for my cybersecurity studies. I am practicing website development, and also doing projects working with building redundent networks.
This repository is used to display the first website I have created in my career using HTML and CSS.
To clone this repository I first created the repository, right clicked on it and clicked clone, this was something I had to do on my github desktop application. I was then promped to select the location for where I wanted to clone this repository on my desktop.
